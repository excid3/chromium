                   How to make a Chromium release
                 (on Linux, using 1.9 as an example)



Coding
======

Update include/cr_version.h with new version numbers.

Update mothership/server/mothership.py and update "Version".

Bump version in mothership/tools/graph.py if the graphical config tool
has been updated since last release.

Bump version in doc/banner.html.

Update doc/versions.html with info about the new version


Make the tarballs
=================

Update cr.mk so that CRNAME is "cr-1.9"
run 'make tarballs'

Now, copy the cr-1.9.tar.gz to a temporary directory, unpack, build and test.



SourceForge update
==================

Upload tarballs to sourceforge:
   ftp upload.sf.net
   user: anonymous
   passwd: email address
   cd incoming
   bin
   put cr-1.9.tar.gz
   put cr-1.9.zip
   bye

Via "Admin" interface on SF, create a new source release named "Chromium 1.9".
Add the .tar.gz and .zip files to the release.

Send an email to chromium-dev, chromium-users, and chromium-announce.



Finally, tag the cvs tree
=========================

   cd cr
   cvs tag release-A-B-C-YYYYMMDD

   where:
      A-B-C is the version, like 1-4-0
      YYYYMMDD is the year, month, day
