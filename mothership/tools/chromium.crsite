# chromium.site

# This file describes your site's Chomium resources.
# You can use it to list all the hosts in your cluster, how large your
# mural display is, the tile sizes, etc.  We'll add new stuff in the
# future.

# This file is read by the Chromium configuration tool in order to
# initialize templates, etc.

# The syntax is that of a Python dictionary which maps variable names to
# values.  This lets us parse the file by simply calling eval()!
